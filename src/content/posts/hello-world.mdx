## Introduction

I'm Reja Revaldy F, a big fan of tech stuff, especially Web Development and Cybersecurity. I'm really into red teaming in Cybersecurity. Besides coding, I like to explore Linux and join cybersecurity competitions, where I tackle challenges like Capture The Flag. I'm always learning to get better at what I do. I also work on website projects a lot to gain more experience in the field.
